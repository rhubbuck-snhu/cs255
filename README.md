Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project was DriverPass. Their aim was to assist student drivers with successfully passing the exams required to gain a driver's license. The overall purpose of the system is to allow students to create account in which they can select and pay for various packages, study exam prep material, study DMV material, take practice exams, and schedule reservations for in-person driving lessons.

What did you do particularly well?
The various diagrams we created during the course of this class have all taught me quite a bit about designing a system. I find my UML class diagram and activity diagrams to be the strength of my project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If given the opportunity, I would ammend the functional and non-functional requirements portion of my project. While I find the information I included to be factually accurate, these were specific areas where I was somewhat unsure and I could have gone into greater detail to desctribe the system better.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The key to interpreting the user's needs was the interview with the DriverPass staff. First, I needed to identify the unique actors who would be using the system, and next I needed to outline all use cases for the system. By defining who would use the system and the specific tasks that would be completed, I was then able to design the classes required to compose the system. It is critical to consider the user's needs to ensure that the system is capable of completing all actions required of the system to satisfy the client.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
One key aspect that was outlined in this course is the important of an iterative software design approach. While emphasis was places on capturing as many system requirements as possible early on, the structure of the course allowed me to expand upon these items module by module until the system was fully flushed out. In addition, I like to take my time early in the designing process to manually write out all actors, use cases, and classes for the system. Following this, I read back through the interview and double checked my list. Taking time to fully plan out my thoughts before creating any documentation helps reduce the likelihood of missing key aspects of the system.
